{"text": " Are you a current university student or recent graduate interested in getting an internship or an entry-level job at Google? I'm Jules, a Googler working on our intern team. And I'm Ocus, a technical recruiter. In this video, we're gonna break down some common misconceptions that students have about applying to Google. However, we also recommend watching our full set of interview prep videos, including a more detailed overview of our hiring process. To watch these, click the link to our How We Hire playlist in the description below. Let's get into it! First up is one of the most common misconceptions we hear about applying to Google, is that students must come from a top university to have a chance. However, that's not the case. Instead of looking for certain schools, we look for candidates from a variety of backgrounds and experiences. And even though we do ask students for transcripts when they apply, we know that's only one part of your application. Another common misconception we hear is that you need to have an extensive work history to apply. For students and new grads applying to Google, we don't expect you to have years of relevant experience. Instead, we're particularly interested in seeing how you think about and approach problems. If you have limited work experience, feel free to talk about your school-related projects and coursework that demonstrate relevant skills and knowledge. Now let's break down misconceptions about the interview process itself. So you may have heard that we ask brain teasers such as how many golf balls could fit inside of an aircraft. However, we no longer ask these types of questions, because our data shows that brain teasers don't predict how well someone will do on the job. Instead, we focus on worked sample tests and structured interview questions. For more on our application process, check out our How We Hire video on our Life at Google channel. The quick overview of the process that uses search our career site for internship and entry-level positions. Once you find one of the three roles that align with your interests, you can apply online. Some quick advice we always give is to keep your resume concise, ideally one page, and have someone else read it over for you. If you don't have someone to double-check for you, make sure you read it from bottom to top and read it out loud to catch things that you may have missed. Additionally, be sure you're demonstrating impact through your bullet points. When in doubt, lean on the formula, accomplish X as measured by Y by doing Z. After you submit your application, someone from the recruiting team will review it and reach out to you if you're matched to the role. From there, you may be given a variety of assessments to assess your aptitude. From brief online assessments such as a coding quiz, to examples of project work, to eventually interviews. After your interviews are done, we'll bring everything together from your application and interviews and review it. Many Googlers at various levels are involved in this review, and if everything is approved, your recruiter will get in touch to make an offer. If you need any interview accommodations, our recruiting team is here to help. From sign language interpreters to specialized equipment, and from interview breaks to extended time, we aim to provide the support you need so that you can keep the focus on your interviews. All you need to do is inform your recruiter that you need accommodations, no need to share details, and they'll connect you with our candidate accommodations team. And that's how we hire for internships and entry-level roles here at Google. Again, visit the playlist on our Life at Google channel linked below for a more in-depth look at our process and how to prepare for our interviews.
